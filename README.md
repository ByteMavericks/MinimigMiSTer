# MinimigMiSTer

MinimigMiSTer is an attempt to simplify the setup process for Minimig on MiSTerFPGA.  It takes the extra files needed for RTG and the Shared directory with linux, assembles them into an ADF that Minimig can access, and provides a script to install everything nicely on the Amiga side.

##Instructions
Have a working minimig configuration (!) based on OS3.X
Download Setup_Amiga_Driverdisks.sh and place in your /media/fat/Scripts directory
invoke from scripts menu
Boot Minimig, attach MisterUtils.adf (in /media/fat/games/Amiga/setup) as df0: and Picasso96.adf as df1:
Double click on the Setup_Minimig icon

And let me know of any issues!
